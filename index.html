            <h2>Here are some battles showcasing his qualities as a general:
            </h2>
             <h3>Battle of the chains:
             </h3>
              <p>The persian general chains up his elite sloldiers to show the muslims there is no retreat, but also because khalid relied on cavalry it would be impssoble to do a cavalry charge, the way battles went back then is each side would send champions to fight before battle, khalid said i am my champion, i will fight the persian champion thats a problem for the persian general because if he doesn't go fight it make him look like a coward, so the persian genral goes out to fight and gets killed in 30 seconds. Now the persian is fighting without a general, and what khaslid did is use his cavalry to break up the enemy's balance until he broke up their order, and they should've retreated and repositioned, but they cant because they're chained together, then he swung his cavalry around the backside and tore the persians to pieces, the same persians who tore the romans to pieces.</p>
             <h3>Battle of Hira:
             </h3>
              <p>Khalid kept going i'll be your champion every battle, so the enemy general  does the same thing and the first thing in the battle is the persian general gets killed, so the persain general this time predicted this and buried a dozen soldiers where he thought the challenge will take place with straws, so they could breath through the night so in the morning he would come out and do the challenge, and once it starts the 12 persians jump out and murder khalid.Khalid walks out, the genral walks out, and soldiers jump out, and one of khalid's cousins who was in the army sees this, runs out and joins klhalid,<strong> and the two men kill the 13 persians.</strong> Then the arabs destroy the persian army.</p>
             <h3>Battle of Walaja:
             </h3>
              <p>This time two Sasanian armies were sent against Khalid. He quickly brought one of them to battle at Walaja before the other could join it. Both armies had ridges to their rear. Khalid sneaked all his cavalry behind the Sasanian ridge. The next day the battle took place. Khalid ordered his center to fall back while he extended his flanks, drawing the Sasanians into a U-shaped trap. Then he ordered his cavalry to charge from behind, sealing the U. The entire Sasanian army was destroyed with Khalid’s use of the double envelopment tactic. A few thousand men managed to escape but they died of thirst in the desert.</p>
            <h3>Battles on the way to Unbar:
            </h3>    
             <p>60 thousand persians in three units, 20 thousand each are coming after him while planning to merge, he is down to 15 after winning 3 battles, the odds will be four to one if the persian units merge and he's thinking he cant beat 60 thousand head on, he has to attack them seperatly for a chance of winning, so he races his army to the first section of the persian army, but first he cuts his army into three five thousand man units, and he tells them we are gonna arrive at a certain time and gives a date two weeks in advance and he says I need you at this location at this time on this day and they take 3 different paths to come at this persian unit , they're there at the specified time and they catch the persian army at night, sleeping in their camps, then khalid goes this is where the next persian army is gonna be and points on a map he says I need you at this location at this time on thsi day, again, 3 diffrent paths, and the three units chage as fast as they can and the persian army is again where he predicted ,they decimate the second persian unit, one more time, specific time, location, and again, the muslin units   attacks the persians at night . Khalid had accurately predicted the location of the marching units three times in a row, thanks to that they dispatched 60 thousand persians with 15 thousand muslim arabs.</p>
